				<h2>A Call to Arms</h2>
				<p>
					Friends, I call upon you today to rise up in arms against those who claim America needs a King, 
					those who seek to cheapen and undermine that which we love, those who believe that one size fits 
					all and ignore your personal opinions in an attempt to make you believe that being unique is uncouth. 
					
					<br /><br />

					Make no mistake about it, this will be WAR and it will NOT be a fair fight.  They have strength in their 
					numbers and size, but we have heart and God on our side.  We must band together in small militias, 
					and at every turn in the road we will strike and they will lose a few men.  This is not a war to be fought 
					with guns, but rather with your wallets.  Every purchase you make will be like cannon fire.  With every 
					truly craft six pack you purchase the enemy will feel the blow.  They will scramble to make you believe 
					that they have adopted the standards that we demand and a quality high enough for us to accept but 
					we must send them back to the foreigners to whom they sold their souls.  And friends they will try and 
					may succeed at breaking those whose names we bring to the forefront.  But I beg of you, friends, do 
					not fall for their trickery and never forget what they have done, polluting our bars and groceries with a 
					fizzy yellow piss poor uninspiring excuse for BEER.  And I promise you that if we continue to fight they 
					will eventually topple, and we will stand united in victory.
					
					<br /><br />

					We know that beer is more than a drink; it is a liquid ode to our past, our present, and our future.  It 
					holds within its amber body our deepest secrets and most honest feelings.  It is an ever evolving art form 
					that has grown with the human race since the dawn of civilization.  It is a nutritious liquid expression of 
					who we are as individuals.  The beer you choose to enjoy tells the world something about you.  Don’t let 
					that something be that you are just like everyone else, just another face in the crowd, just another 
					nobody who care cares not for quality and will accept the cheapest of products in order to fit in with the 
					masses.  Just like you and I every beer has a unique history all its own, a story to tell, and 
					characteristics that make it one of a kind.  However there are some who believe that you can be 
					accurately depicted by the lowest quality ingredients mixed together by people who answer to 
					shareholders halfway across the Earth.  And it is to them that I shake my fist in anger and vow to break 
					their mass produced soulless “beer” (if you can even call it that).  We cherish the Sistine Chapel because 
					it was not mass produced; let us do the same with our beer.
					
					<br /><br />

					Drink local, help your neighbors, and don’t give a penny of your hard earned money to the enemy.
					
					<br /><br />

					-B. Casey
